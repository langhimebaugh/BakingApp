Baking App – DUE July 23

Overview
In this project, you will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps
for how to complete it.

This will involve
• Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
• handle media loading
• verify your user interfaces with UI tests
• TODO: Handle error cases in Android.
• Add a widget to your app experience.
• Leverage a third-party library in your app.
• Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
• adding accessibility features
• allowing for localization

Project Rubric
• Display recipes - App should display recipes from provided network resource.
• App Navigation - App should allow navigation between individual recipes and recipe steps.
• Utilization of RecyclerView - App uses RecyclerView and can handle recipe steps that include videos or images.
• Master Detail Flow and Fragments - Application uses Master Detail Flow to display recipe steps and navigation between them.
• Exoplayer(MediaPlayer) to display videos - Application uses Exoplayer to display videos.
• Proper utilization of video assets - Application properly initializes and releases video assets when appropriate.
• Proper network asset utilization - Application should properly retrieve media assets from the provided network links. It should properly
        handle network requests.
• UI Testing - Application makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI.
• Third-party libraries - Application sensibly utilizes a third-party library to enhance the app's features. That could be helper library to
        interface with ContentProviders if you choose to store the recipes, a UI binding library to avoid writing findViewById a bunch of times, or
        something similar.
• Application has a companion homescreen widget.
• Widget displays ingredient list for desired recipe.
        clicking widget opens app to proper page... RecipeStepListActivity.
        Back navigation works fine if app was open before clicking the widget.
        However back navigation does NOT work if app is not open before clicking the widget.
        Maybe something with the back stack.
